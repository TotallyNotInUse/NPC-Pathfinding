# NPC Pathfinding
A project I did because I was bored on big scale NPC pathfinding.

# About
Handling a lot of NPCs (50+) can lead to the Roblox engine severely struggling with doing multiple pathfinding operations at the same time. I solved this issue by creating a queue system for pathfinding requests.

# Known Issues
Sometimes (<9%) requests will get "lost" and not completed (even though it reportedly gets completed). I'm still investigating the reason of this.
